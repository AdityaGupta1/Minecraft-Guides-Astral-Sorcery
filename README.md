# Welcome to the Astral Sorcery Github Repository! 

Using Github we are able to update and edit each guide without having to take each guide offline! This also allows other GitHub users to add updates to each guide whether it be corrections or updates. This also allows us to save older versions of each guide as an archive.

Using githubs also enables us to have strict version control and makes it much simpler to communicate changes with everyone.

As we move each guide to GitHub/Website the associated Google Doc will be closed, Google Docs will only be used as an initial starting point of each guide.

Every page and image from each guides website is here!

## How it works
Editing guides and having your changes be accepted is relatively simple and can be done by anyone who has a GitHub account.

Once you have logged in and you know what page you want to edit you will need to navigate to that page.

There are 2 types of Pages, Docs and Chapters, each page is in a .MD format (more details on MarkDown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). The only pages anyone will need to edit are docs.md.

Each page has its own Folder and in that Folder is the page (docs.md) with all the content. Any images that are attached to each page are within the pages folder.

Once you know which page you want to edit click the edit pencil, this will allow you to edit the page.

Once you have made your edits fill in the 2 boxes below with details on your changes and press “Propose File Change”.

Please not that you will need to fill in the comments section before submitting your changes. No changes will be accepted if you give no details or reasons for your changes.

Once you have proposed your changes you can click “Generate Pull Request” this will notify us on what changes you have made. We will either Deny or Accept your request. We will always give you details on why your request has been denied.
